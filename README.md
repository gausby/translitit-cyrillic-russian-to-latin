Russian Cyrillic to Latin Transliteration
=================================================
<strong>Notice</strong>: This project and [translitit-engine][translitit-engine] are looking for a new maintainer. I [Martin Gausby](https://github.com/gausby) spend most of my days having fun with Elixir and that sort of thing. If you find Translitit useful and want to maintain it I will happily grand or transfer maintainer privileges to you or your organization. Thanks.

A JavaScript function that transliterate strings from cyrillic russian to latin.

This project is build using the [translitit-engine][translitit-engine], and its unit tests has been lifted from [Staltec][staltec]'s project called [transliteration.cyr][transliteration.cyr].

Please note. I ([Martin Gausby](https://github.com/gausby)) do not speak Russian, so I can not know if this package transliterate 100% correct. Please file bug reports, add unit tests and even try to fix problems if you find some. Pull requests are more than welcome.

The motivation for this project was to test the transliteration engine I created.

[staltec]: https://github.com/Staltec
[transliteration.cyr]: https://github.com/Staltec/transliteration

## Installation and Usage
Add it to your npm-based project by typing the following in your project root.

    npm install translitit-cyrillic-russian-to-latin --save

Now, you can include the transliteration service in your project by including it:

    var translit = require('translitit-cyrillic-russian-to-latin');

`translit` will now be a function, that will transliterate its input.

    translit('Борщагівка'); // returns 'Borshchagivka'


## Development
After cloning the project you will have to run `npm install` in the project root. This will install the various grunt plugins and other dependencies.


### QA tools
The QA tools rely on the [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) task runner. To run any of these tools, you will need the grunt-cli installed globally on your system. This is easily done by typing the following in a terminal.

    $ npm install grunt-cli -g

The unit tests will need the [Buster](http://busterjs.org/) unit test framework.

    $ npm install -g buster

These two commands will install the buster and grunt commands on your system. These can be removed by typing `npm uninstall buster -g` and `npm uninstall grunt-cli -g`.


#### Unit Tests
When developing you want to run the script watcher. Navigate to the project root and type the following in your terminal.

    $ grunt watch:scripts

This will run the jshint and tests each time a file has been modified.
